        <p>Hello, my name is Haeju Lee. I'm from South Korea and still live in here.
            <br />I studied for Spanish and Japanese when I in university.
            <br />So I lived in Mexico for 5 months to study Spanish and cultural things.
            <br />But now, as you guys know, I'm learning Computer Science.
            <br />It's not easy. Especially to me, everything is challenge. 
            <br />Neverthless I like to study coding. When I fix a error, I am thrilled with joy!
            <br />I don't want a stable life. I think Life is a challenging. 
            <br />This is why I choose the whole different way regardless of my mayjor.
